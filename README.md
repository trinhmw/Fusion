# Fusion
An application created for finding identifying fusion combination in Devil Survivor.  
## Credits  
The following was used to complete this application libraries and code:  
[Vogella's Java Dijkstra's Algorithm](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaAlgorithmsDijkstra/article.html)  
[opencsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/)  
[aFileChooser by Paul Burke](https://github.com/iPaulPro/aFileChooser)



## Setup:
1. Place the "DevilSurvivorFusion.csv" on your phone and install the apk
2. Tap on "Open File" and select "DevilSurvivorFusion.csv" (or your own personal csv for another game)
3. Tap on "Load File" and wait until you see "Load Complete"

## Functions:
* List Possibilities - Select one fusion result you want, and it will list all the possible fusion combinations that you can perform to get that result.
* Fusion Result - Select your two fusion materials/parts and it will tell you the result of the fusion
* Path Finder - Select one of your fusion materials/parts and select your desired result. The left side of the screen is for your Target Fusion, in other words your main goal. The right side is there as a supplementary, such as when you don't have one of the items needed to fuse your Target, then you would use the right side, without getting distracted to the point you don't remember what you were trying to fuse in the first place. Do note that when you change your target fusion, it automatically clears the text on the right side.
